MNIST Classification using KERAS
This is project using MLP and CNN for MNIST data classification using KERAS. The best proactises were followed to avoid overfitting. This resulted in 99.6% in the MNSIT and EMNIST test dataset after 20 epoch and 98.3% is an unknown handwritten data set. This was run in google colab. In order to avoid overfitting the the following methods were followed
1. Batch Normalisation
2. DropOuts
3. Data Augmentation
